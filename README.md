# Backend-Based Todolist
A good-old todolist, built with NodeJS and Express, and connected to MongoDB through Mongoose.

This project is made as homework in my course "dynamisk webbutveckling" at Medieinstitutet, and includes the following features:

 - Fully functional server that's capable of CRUD operations
 - Result pagination, ability to sort by date
 - Nightmode, CSS toggle made completely from scratch!
 - Real-time clock, tells day of week, date of year, and display a greeting based on time of day.

To install, download the bodebase, open in your code editor of choice, open your terminal and install all dependencies by typing `npm install`, then type in `npm start` to start running the application. 

Note that the URI to my database is stored in a hidden `.env` file that is ***not*** included in this repository, and you will therefore need your own MongoDB Atlas account to use this todo app. Visit the MongoDB [website](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to register a new account.
